Orange Boilerplate
==================

Grunt, LESS and include-replace for all your webapp development needs. Project is meant primarily for Orange Hill Development internal use but feel free to use it if you like it. 

Project will be maintained on a as-needed basis, so while you're free to submit issues and PRs these will only be solved/merged if we feel it's in the interest of our internal development process.

Instructions
------------

1. Create a project folder (e.g. `/projects/orange-project`)
2. Create a folder named `dev` in the project folder (`/projects/orange-project/dev`)
3. Clone orange-boilerplate to `dev` folder, NOT the project folder!
4. Run `npm install` and `bower install` in `dev`. 
5. That's it, you're ready to `grunt serve`. Have fun!
